I am a first-year graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I am advised by Prof. [Josep Torrellas](https://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/josep/torrellas.html) as a part of the i-acoma group. My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Architecture and Operating Systems, with a focus on building efficient, high-performance, and secure computing environments.

Prior to joining UIUC, I completed my undergraduate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB). For my thesis, I worked under the supervision of Prof. [Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/) on Enhancing Security of Modern Computing Systems, exploring defenses at the hardware interface. I also had the privilege of working with Prof. [Satish Mulleti](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/satish-mulleti/) at IITB and Prof. [Hyesoon Kim](https://hyesoon.github.io/) at Georgia Tech.
