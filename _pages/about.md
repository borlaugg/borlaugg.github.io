I am a graduate researcher at UIUC, working under the supervision of Prof. Josep Torrellas as part of the i-acoma group. My work focuses on Computer Architecture and Operating Systems.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree from IIT Bombay, where I conducted research under Prof. Virendra Singh and Prof. Satish Mulleti. Additionally, I have collaborated with Prof. Hyesoon Kim at Georgia Tech on GPU architectures. I am passionate about building the next generation of high-performance, hardware-software integrated systems.
